# 1. Introduction
The Xilinx reVISION stack includes a range of development resources for platform, algorithm and application development. This includes support for the most popular neural networks including AlexNet, GoogLeNet, VGG, SSD, and FCN. Additionally, the stack provides library elements including pre-defined and optimized implementations for CNN network layers, required to build custom neural networks (DNN/CNN). The machine learning elements are complemented by a broad set of acceleration ready OpenCV functions for computer vision processing. For application level development, Xilinx supports industry standard frameworks and libraries including Caffe for machine learning and OpenCV for computer vision. The reVISION stack also includes development platforms from Xilinx and third parties, including various types of sensors. For more information go to the [Xilinx reVISION webpage](http://www.Xilinx.com/reVISION).
